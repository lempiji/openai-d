### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-15 22:40]
  - **Task**: Update .gitignore to track docs folder
  - **Objective**: Keep docs under version control while ignoring temporary files
  - **Outcome**: Adjusted ignore rules and verified project checks

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Formatting, linting, and tests ran without issues
  - Removing the `docs/` entry was straightforward

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Running the full test suite took a couple minutes in the container

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Provide a cached build of dependencies to speed up `dub test`
