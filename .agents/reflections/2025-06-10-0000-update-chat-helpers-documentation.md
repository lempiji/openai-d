### :book: Reflection for 2025-06-10 00:00
  - **Task**: Update chat helpers documentation
  - **Objective**: Expand comments for message constructors and document `chatCompletionRequest` parameters.
  - **Outcome**: Added detailed doc comments and verified formatting, linting, tests, coverage and example builds.

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Project tooling caught formatting issues automatically.

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Building all examples takes time due to compilation of dependencies.

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Provide pre-built artifacts or a cached dependencies layer to speed up example builds.
