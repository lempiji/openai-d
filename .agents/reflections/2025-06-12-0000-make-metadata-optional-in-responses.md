### :book: Reflection for 2025-06-12 00:00
  - **Task**: Make metadata optional in responses
  - **Objective**: Ensure API structs support optional metadata fields
  - **Outcome**: Added `@serdeOptional` attribute, updated formatting, linting, tests, coverage and example builds

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Toolchain handled formatting and building examples reliably

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Coverage files clutter the repo root and are hard to review

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Provide a script to summarize coverage results and clean up old lst files
