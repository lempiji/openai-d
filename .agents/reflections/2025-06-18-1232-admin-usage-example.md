### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-18 12:32]
  - **Task**: Add administration usage example
  - **Objective**: Demonstrate retrieval of usage data with listUsageCompletions and ensure builds succeed
  - **Outcome**: Implemented a new example usage.d with corresponding configuration and verified builds, tests and formatting

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - The build script allowed verifying individual example packages easily
  - Using DUB configurations kept existing examples intact while adding a new one

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Figuring out the correct SDLang syntax for configuration blocks was tricky and resulted in initial build failures
  - Fetching documentation online required several attempts due to path uncertainty

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Add a local examples/dub.sdl snippet documenting multi-configuration syntax to speed up future additions
