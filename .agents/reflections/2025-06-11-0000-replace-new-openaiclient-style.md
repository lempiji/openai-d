### :book: Reflection for 2025-06-11 00:00
  - **Task**: Replace new `OpenAIClient` style
  - **Objective**: Match README style across examples
  - **Outcome**: Updated every example to use `new OpenAIClient()` and verified formatting, linting, tests, coverage, and builds.

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Tooling automated formatting and linting effectively.

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Building each example individually remains slow.

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Add a script to build all examples in parallel.
