### :book: Reflection for 2025-06-13 14:38
  - **Task**: Archive reflection for build script
  - **Objective**: Move an outdated reflection file to the archive folder
  - **Outcome**: Successfully moved the reflection and committed the change

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Pre-merge checks completed without errors

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Local Linux environment: build artifacts remained after running `scripts/build_examples.sh`, requiring manual cleanup

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Update the build script or `.gitignore` to automatically exclude generated binaries to avoid manual cleanup
