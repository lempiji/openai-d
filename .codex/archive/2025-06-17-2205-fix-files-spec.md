### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-17 22:05]
  - **Task**: Fix Files API spec compliance
  - **Objective**: Align enums and models with OpenAI spec and update documentation
  - **Outcome**: Updated models and README, added missing package import and ensured example builds

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - OpenAPI spec fetched from GitHub helped verify fields
  - Automated formatting and tests caught missing status field

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Manual spec review was time-consuming due to large YAML file
  - Initial build failed because example imports were missing

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Add script to parse spec snippets automatically for future API updates
  - Cache example build artifacts to avoid recompilation
