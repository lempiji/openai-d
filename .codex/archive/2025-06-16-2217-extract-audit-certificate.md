### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-16 22:17]
  - **Task**: Extract audit certificate struct
  - **Objective**: Remove duplicated nested structs in audit log events
  - **Outcome**: Added `AuditLogEventCertificate` and updated activation/deactivation events

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Fixing the duplication only touched a small code section
  - Formatter and tests ran quickly with cached dependencies

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Example builds still print many deprecation warnings
  - Linter fetch step slows down first runs

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Cache dscanner and example dependencies in CI to cut setup time
  - Investigate suppressing or fixing mir-core deprecation warnings
