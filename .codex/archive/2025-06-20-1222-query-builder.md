### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-20 12:22]
  - **Task**: Update query builder usage
  - **Objective**: Refactor URL generation functions to use QueryParamsBuilder and adjust tests.
  - **Outcome**: Functions now rely on centralized builder; tests and examples pass.

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - The builder API simplified code and reduced manual encoding logic.
  - Existing tests required only minor updates, confirming behavior stayed consistent.

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Fetching dependencies for dfmt and dscanner slowed the feedback loop in CI-like environment.
  - Example builds take noticeable time even when unchanged.

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Provide a cached container image or preinstalled dependencies to avoid repeated fetch/build steps.
  - Introduce an incremental example build system to skip unchanged targets more aggressively.
