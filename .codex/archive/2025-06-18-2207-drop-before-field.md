### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-18 22:07]
  - **Task**: Remove deprecated "before" parameter
  - **Objective**: Update ListFiles API to drop obsolete query parameter and adjust tests
  - **Outcome**: Implemented changes, all checks pass

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Running dfmt, lint and tests was straightforward
  - Automated tooling caught missing code removal quickly

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Initial test run failed because old code references remained
  - Compiling with large dependencies makes linter start slowly

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Provide helper scripts to automatically run formatter, linter and tests together
