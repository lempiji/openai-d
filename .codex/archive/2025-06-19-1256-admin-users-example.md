### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-19 12:56]
  - **Task**: Document admin users example
  - **Objective**: Update README with a new administration example and mark users feature complete
  - **Outcome**: Added snippet, updated example references, and finalized checklist entry

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Build and test process succeeded without issues
  - Automated formatting and linting kept style consistent

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Example builds generated unwanted artifacts that required cleanup
  - Long build times for examples slowed iteration

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Provide a make target to clean example build artifacts automatically
