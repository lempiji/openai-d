### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-19 13:30]
  - **Task**: Add project user models and endpoints
  - **Objective**: Support administration project user API and example
  - **Outcome**: Implemented structs, client methods, tests, and example

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Leveraged upstream OpenAPI spec to implement accurate models
  - Automated tests and formatting ensured consistent code quality

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Running build_examples.sh produced no output initially, making troubleshooting slow on CI-like environments
  - Downloading and parsing the large OpenAPI spec was time-consuming

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Enhance build_examples.sh with clearer logging when no targets are selected to reduce confusion
  - Cache the OpenAPI spec locally to avoid repeated large downloads
