### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-13 14:36]
  - **Task**: Document reflection archiving workflow
  - **Objective**: Provide clear instructions for moving reflections once improvements are implemented
  - **Outcome**: Added AGENTS.md in `.codex/reflections` explaining the steps

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Documentation change required no code modifications and was easy to apply

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Local: Reviewing long commit histories with `git log` is time-consuming

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Create a helper script that lists reflections with unimplemented improvements
