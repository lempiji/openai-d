### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-20 12:23]
  - **Task**: Add validate method to configuration and update clients
  - **Objective**: Centralize configuration checks and use them in clients
  - **Outcome**: Added new method, removed duplicate client code, tests pass

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - The change simplified constructors by removing redundant code
  - Automated formatting and linting kept code style consistent

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Running example builds took noticeable time on each cycle
  - Linter installation logs cluttered console output

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Provide a cached build directory for examples to speed up iterative testing
