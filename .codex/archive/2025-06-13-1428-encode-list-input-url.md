### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-13 14:28]
  - **Task**: Update buildListInputItemsUrl to encode query values and add tests
  - **Objective**: Ensure query parameters are URL encoded when building list input items URLs
  - **Outcome**: Function updated with std.uri.encodeComponent and new unittest verifies encoding; formatter, linter, tests and coverage all succeed

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Code modifications were straightforward and unit tests provided quick verification

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Local, Ubuntu: `dub lint` fetched many dependencies and built tools which slowed the workflow

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Cache prebuilt linter binaries to avoid repeated compilation during development
