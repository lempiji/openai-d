### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-20 17:24]
  - **Task**: Document helper scripts and quick experiment workflow
  - **Objective**: Clarify how to run project scripts and small D examples
  - **Outcome**: Added new section in AGENTS.md describing rdmd usage, DUB single-file mode and planned dependency sync script

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Documentation changes required no code updates
  - The repository already had clear formatting guidelines

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Remembering the proper rdmd command for each script slows me down
  - Creating each reflection file manually feels repetitive

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Provide a template helper that generates reflection files with the current timestamp
