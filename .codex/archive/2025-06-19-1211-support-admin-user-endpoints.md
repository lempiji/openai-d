### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-19 12:11]
  - **Task**: add admin user endpoints
  - **Objective**: expand the OpenAI client with functions for managing organization users
  - **Outcome**: implemented list, retrieve, modify, and delete user API calls with accompanying tests

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - The existing patterns for other admin functions made it straightforward to implement the new methods
  - Automated formatting, linting, tests and example builds ensured consistency

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Running the example build script produced numerous deprecation warnings which cluttered the output
  - dfmt and dscanner downloads slowed down the feedback loop in the container environment

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Cache dfmt and dscanner binaries within the development container to avoid repeated downloads
  - Investigate suppressing or addressing deprecation warnings to keep build logs concise
