### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-12 21:07]
  - **Task**: Clean up unused import in setupHttpByConfig
  - **Objective**: Remove the unnecessary `canFind` import and ensure compilation passes
  - **Outcome**: The import was deleted and tests still pass

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Simple code cleanup with clear instructions

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Accidentally removed another import during sed, causing a compile error which required an extra fix

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Implement a pre-commit script that scans for compilation errors before running full test suite to catch mistakes earlier
