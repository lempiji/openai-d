### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-19 03:45]
- **Task**: add user models and tests
- **Objective**: extend administration module with user management structures and ensure coverage
- **Outcome**: new structs and tests added successfully

#### :sparkles: What went well
- mir.serde annotations were straightforward to replicate
- automated dfmt and linter kept style consistent

#### :warning: Pain points
- example build script generated many untracked files, requiring manual cleanup
- viewing long build logs in the container was cumbersome

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
- update build script to place temporary outputs in a clean directory or auto-clean after running to avoid polluting git status
