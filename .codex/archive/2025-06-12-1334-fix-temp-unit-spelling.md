### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-12 13:34]
  - **Task**: Correct temperature unit typos
  - **Objective**: Replace misspelled "celcius" and "farenheit" in JSON schema examples and run checks
  - **Outcome**: Spelling fixed and all checks passed

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Straightforward text changes made quickly
  - Formatter, linter, and tests all ran without issues

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Running coverage and linter fetches many dependencies each time, which slows feedback

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Add a script to set up and cache D dependencies between tasks to speed up lint and coverage runs
