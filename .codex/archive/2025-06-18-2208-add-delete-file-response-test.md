### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-18 22:08]
  - **Task**: Add unittest for DeleteFileResponse
  - **Objective**: Ensure delete-file responses deserialize correctly
  - **Outcome**: Added test and confirmed all checks pass

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Straightforward test addition and automation
  - Project's scripts built examples without issues once run fully

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Example builds generate many temporary artifacts requiring cleanup
  - Build output is quite verbose, making it hard to know when it completes

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Provide a cleaned example build mode that avoids generating `dub.selections.json` or binaries to reduce cleanup effort
