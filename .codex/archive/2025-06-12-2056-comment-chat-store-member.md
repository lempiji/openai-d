### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-12 20:56]
  - **Task**: Comment out store member in chat.d and adjust docs/tests
  - **Objective**: Remove usage of store parameter per OpenAI data policy
  - **Outcome**: Store field commented out, code formatted, linted and tests pass

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Straightforward change, tests already covered serialization without store

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Running dfmt and dscanner takes time due to dependencies

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Provide cached binaries for dfmt/dscanner to speed up CI and local runs
