  - **Task**: Implement Images API
  - **Objective**: Add image generation support with enums, client methods, examples and docs
  - **Outcome**: Added new module, client functions, example program, tests and documentation

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - OpenAPI spec helped confirm request fields
  - Tests, formatter and linter ran without issues

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Local lint step downloaded dependencies each run which was slow
