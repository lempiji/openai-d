### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-13 15:33]
  - **Task**: Implement Administration API support
  - **Objective**: Add administration data structures and client
  - **Outcome**: Module and example added

#### :sparkles: What went well
    - Familiarity with existing code helped integrate new features quickly

#### :warning: Pain points
    - Local build of linter and coverage was slow because dependencies were fetched each time
  - Example: "CI, Ubuntu: `dub test` step took ~3 minutes to resolve dependencies."

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Cache dub dependencies between runs to speed up lint and test steps
