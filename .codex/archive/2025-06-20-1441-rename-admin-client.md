### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-20 14:41]
- **Task**: Rename admin client file
- **Objective**: Align module naming with project conventions by renaming clients/admin.d
- **Outcome**: Renamed file and updated imports; all tests and examples still build.

#### :sparkles: What went well
- Automated formatting and linting ensured style consistency.
- Comprehensive example build confirmed library stability after rename.

#### :warning: Pain points
- Building all examples was slow due to compiling many dependencies locally.
- `git clean` needed after builds to remove generated artifacts.

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
- Provide a script to clean build artifacts and revert dub selections automatically after example builds.
