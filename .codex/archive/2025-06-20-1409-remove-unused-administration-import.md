### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-20 14:09]
  - **Task**: remove unused administration import
  - **Objective**: Clean up unused imports in OpenAI client module
  - **Outcome**: Removed the administration module import and verified build

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Automated formatting and linting caught no new issues
  - Tests and example builds ran successfully

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Building examples pulled additional dependencies, slightly slowing feedback
  - Coverage generation produced many files to inspect manually

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Provide a make target that runs formatter, linter, tests, and coverage in one step
