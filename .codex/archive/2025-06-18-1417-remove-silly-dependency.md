### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-18 14:17]
  - **Task**: Remove obsolete 'silly' dependency lines
  - **Objective**: Clean up example config files and ensure build passes
  - **Outcome**: Deleted all references to the unused dependency and verified the full workflow

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Automated sed commands made editing many files quick
  - Build scripts ran without issues once configs were fixed

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Building every example took a long time and produced lots of warnings
  - Linter fetches extra dependencies, causing noise in logs

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Consider caching built dependencies during CI to speed up repeated example builds
