### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-20 14:12]
  - **Task**: Rewrite build_examples.sh in D
  - **Objective**: Provide a cross-platform example build script run via rdmd
  - **Outcome**: Added build_examples.d and updated docs; tests and linters pass

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - D's standard library made it easy to port the bash logic
  - Existing tests and formatting steps verified integration quickly

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Building examples pulled many dependencies each run, slowing feedback
  - Coverage generation created numerous .lst files that must be cleaned up manually

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Cache dub dependencies for examples to speed up iterative builds
