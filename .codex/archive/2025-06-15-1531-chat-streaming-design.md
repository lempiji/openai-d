### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-15 15:31]
  - **Task**: Add chat streaming design document and README link
  - **Objective**: Document planned streaming support and update README
  - **Outcome**: Added new markdown file detailing requirements and proposed API, and linked it from README

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Repository had clear guidelines for formatting and testing
  - Tools like dfmt and dub worked without issues

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Docs directory was ignored in `.gitignore` so adding the file required forcing git add

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Remove `docs/` from `.gitignore` to allow documentation changes without manual overrides
