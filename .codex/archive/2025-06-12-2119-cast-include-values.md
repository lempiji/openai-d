### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-12 21:19]
  - **Task**: Replace to!string with cast(string) in listInputItems
  - **Objective**: Ensure include values are cast directly without to!string
  - **Outcome**: Modified openai.d and passed formatting, linting, tests and coverage

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Smooth build and test workflow

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Compiling examples produced unwanted artifacts that required cleanup

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Add a clean step in build scripts to remove generated binaries automatically
