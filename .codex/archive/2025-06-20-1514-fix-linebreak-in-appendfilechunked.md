### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-20 15:14]
  - **Task**: Fix CI formatter failure due to extra newline
  - **Objective**: Ensure formatter output matches committed sources
  - **Outcome**: Ran dfmt which added expected blank lines and committed the change; CI should now pass

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Automation with dfmt quickly reformatted the file
  - Running tests and example builds verified no regressions

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Formatter installation prints many warnings which clutter logs
  - Example builds take considerable time in the container

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Provide prebuilt dfmt and dscanner binaries in the environment to speed up runs
