### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-19 14:09]
  - **Task**: implement project service account structs
  - **Objective**: extend administration module with service account models and tests
  - **Outcome**: added new structs with serialization annotations, convenience constructors, and unit tests; all checks pass

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Accessing the official OpenAPI spec provided accurate field names
  - Existing patterns for models and tests made implementation straightforward

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Running dfmt and lint downloads dependencies each time, which slows feedback
  - Example builds emit many deprecation warnings that obscure important messages

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Cache dfmt and dscanner artifacts between runs in CI and local development to reduce wait time
  - Silence or address deprecation warnings in example builds for clearer output
