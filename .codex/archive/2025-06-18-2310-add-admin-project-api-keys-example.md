### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-18 23:10]
  - **Task**: Add administration project API keys example
  - **Objective**: Demonstrate project API key management with OpenAIClient
  - **Outcome**: Created new example directory with sample code and build configuration

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Leveraged existing administration examples to implement the new one quickly
  - Tooling (dfmt, tests, builds) ran without issues once extraneous files were cleaned

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Building examples added `dub.selections.json` and executables that needed manual removal
  - Linter install pulled additional dependencies, slowing the process

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Update build scripts and `.gitignore` to prevent untracked artifacts like `dub.selections.json` and binaries from cluttering the working tree
  - Cache linter dependencies to reduce setup time
