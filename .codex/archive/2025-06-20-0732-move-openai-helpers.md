### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-20 07:32]
  - **Task**: Move helper functions used only by OpenAIClient
  - **Objective**: Clean up ClientHelpers mixin and inline OpenAI-specific helpers
  - **Outcome**: Functions moved, mixin simplified and tests pass

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Automated formatting and linting ran smoothly
  - Refactoring compiled and tests succeeded on first try

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Large source files made locating helper definitions tedious
  - dscanner download slowed down linting step in CI environment

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Split openai.d into smaller modules to speed up navigation and reduce patch size
