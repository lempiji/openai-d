### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-16 00:43]
  - **Task**: enforce API key requirement
  - **Objective**: add config validation and test
  - **Outcome**: api key presence enforced with unit test

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - dfmt and lint ran smoothly
  - tests and examples built without issues

#### :warning: Pain points
  - building examples produces many deprecation warnings slowing logs
  - coverage files need manual inspection each time

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - add script to summarize coverage and filter warnings for quicker review
