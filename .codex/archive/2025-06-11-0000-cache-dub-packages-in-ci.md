### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-11 00:00]
  - **Task**: Cache Dub packages in CI
  - **Objective**: Speed up continuous integration by avoiding repeated downloads
  - **Outcome**: Added actions/cache steps to store `~/.dub/packages` on Linux and Windows

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Workflow configuration was straightforward to extend

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Cross-platform paths for Dub packages required extra attention

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Document recommended cache paths for different operating systems
