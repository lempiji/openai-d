### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-12 22:55]
  - **Task**: Update pagination params and tests
  - **Objective**: Ensure query parameters are omitted when empty and maintain coverage
  - **Outcome**: Added helper method and new unittest to verify URL building

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Test suite and examples built without issues

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Local build of examples required fetching dependencies, slowing execution

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Cache Dub dependencies to speed up example builds
