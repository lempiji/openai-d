### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-20 05:43]
  - **Task**: add user role and invite status enums
  - **Objective**: implement typed enums and update models and tests
  - **Outcome**: enums introduced with passing tests and example builds

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Automated formatting and linting caught issues early
  - Accessing the upstream OpenAPI spec provided needed details

#### :warning: Pain points
  - `build_examples.sh` warnings clutter logs during builds
  - Downloading dscanner each run still slows linting

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Cache common tooling like dscanner between runs to speed up checks
