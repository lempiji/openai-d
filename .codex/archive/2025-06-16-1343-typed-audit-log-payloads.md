### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-16 13:43]
- **Task**: Convert audit log payloads to typed structs
- **Objective**: Replace JsonValue fields with explicit types and adjust tests
- **Outcome**: Updated models and test pass after adding many struct definitions

#### :sparkles: What went well
- Mir.serde allowed nested structs to deserialize seamlessly
- Linter and formatter required minimal adjustments

#### :warning: Pain points
- Following the OpenAPI spec manually was tedious and error-prone
- Example builds still produce deprecation warnings cluttering logs

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
- Automate struct generation from the spec to avoid manual translation
