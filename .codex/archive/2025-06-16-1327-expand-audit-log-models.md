### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-16 13:27]
- **Task**: Expand audit log models
- **Objective**: Implement additional audit log structures and update tests.
- **Outcome**: Added new structs, enum, and tests; all checks pass.

#### :sparkles: What went well
- Mir.serde handled the new structs smoothly.
- Example build script confirmed compilation of examples.

#### :warning: Pain points
- Coverage and example builds produced noisy warnings which slowed down verification.

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
- Provide a make target that suppresses repeated deprecation warnings to streamline build output.
