### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-15 16:05]
  - **Task**: Remove template comments from reflections
  - **Objective**: Clean up markdown files and standardize headers
  - **Outcome**: Deleted comment markers and normalized timestamps across reflections

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Sed automation handled all files consistently
  - Tests and coverage passed without issues

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Local, Ubuntu: `dub lint` downloads dependencies every run, slowing feedback
  - Building dfmt and dscanner adds overhead for docs-only changes

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Cache linter and formatter binaries in CI to avoid repeated compilation
  - Provide a lightweight docs workflow skipping example builds
