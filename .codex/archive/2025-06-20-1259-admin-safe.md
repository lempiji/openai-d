### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-20 12:59]
  - **Task**: Mark OpenAIAdminClient module @safe by default
  - **Objective**: Align safety annotations with openai.d
  - **Outcome**: Added @safe: after imports and verified build/test success

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Automated formatting kept style consistent
  - Existing tests ensured no regressions

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Example build produced temporary artifacts that needed cleanup
  - Linter and formatter downloads increased build time in CI-like environment

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Provide a cleanup script in scripts/build_examples.sh to remove artifacts automatically
  - Cache dfmt and dscanner builds between runs to avoid redundant compilation
