### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-17 22:06]
  - **Task**: Review and adjust usage API models
  - **Objective**: Ensure fields match the OpenAPI spec
  - **Outcome**: Corrected the UsageTimeBucket `result` field and updated tests

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Quick diff check highlighted the mismatched key
  - Automated tools ensured formatting and linting were consistent

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Spec inconsistencies caused confusion about property names
  - Example binaries produced by `build_examples.sh` clutter git status

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Add cleanup logic in build script to remove artifacts automatically
  - Provide spec snapshots in repo to avoid fetching during development
