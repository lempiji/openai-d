### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-15 15:36]
  - **Task**: Address README comment
  - **Objective**: Remove redundant streaming note from README as requested
  - **Outcome**: Deleted the extra line and confirmed tests still pass

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Clear diff comment made the change straightforward
  - Automated format, lint, and tests ran quickly

#### :warning: Pain points
  - None for this small fix

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - A small lint script could check for stray README lines referencing features in development
