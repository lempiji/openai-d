### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-19 14:12]
  - **Task**: Update README status for project service accounts
  - **Objective**: Reflect current progress accurately in checklist
  - **Outcome**: README updated and repository checks passed

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Task was small and straightforward
  - Automated checks ensured no formatting or test regressions

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Building example binaries produced many temporary artifacts
  - Cleaning those artifacts took extra time before commit

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Adjust example build script to place artifacts in a dedicated ignored directory
  - This would avoid cluttering version control with build outputs
