### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-20 14:59]
  - **Task**: condense url tests
  - **Objective**: Reduce repetition in URL builder unit tests
  - **Outcome**: Added loop-based checks in `openai.d` and helper test in `openai_admin.d`.

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Formatter and linter quickly showed no style issues.
  - Loops simplified a large block of repetitive test code.

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Example build step produced many deprecation warnings, slowing feedback.
  - `dub test` output lacked a clear success message, requiring re-run to confirm.

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Add a verbose flag or summary output to the example build script so successes are more obvious.
