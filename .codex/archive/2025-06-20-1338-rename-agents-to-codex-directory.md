### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-20 13:38]
  - **Task**: Rename `.agents` directory to `.codex`
  - **Objective**: Ensure all references and instructions remain consistent after the rename
  - **Outcome**: Directory and path references updated; tests and checks run successfully

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - All references were easily located with grep
  - CI-like checks passed locally without issues

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Running example builds created temporary artifacts that required cleanup
  - Linter output was verbose and slowed down review

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Automate cleanup of build artifacts in the example build script
