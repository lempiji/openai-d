### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-17 13:33]
  - **Task**: Implement usage and cost structs with tests
  - **Objective**: Extend administration module to support usage API models and add related tests
  - **Outcome**: Added new data structures, request builders, and serialization tests passing all checks

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - mir.serde handled the new structs smoothly once discriminators were set
  - Running formatter and linter automated code style compliance

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Initial attempt at multi-line JSON strings caused parsing errors due to D's q"" syntax
  - `Algebraic` unions required explicit discriminators to deserialize correctly

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Provide helper utilities or documentation for safely embedding long JSON examples in tests
