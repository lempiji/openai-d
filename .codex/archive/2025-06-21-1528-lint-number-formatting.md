### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-21 15:28]
  - **Task**: Fix linter warnings
  - **Objective**: Ensure code passes dscanner style checks
  - **Outcome**: Updated numeric literals with underscores and verified tests pass

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Automated linting quickly pointed out formatting issues
  - Formatter and linter integration ensured consistent style

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Linter initially failed with minimal context about the warnings
  - Rebuilding dscanner each run slowed feedback slightly in this environment

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Cache dscanner binaries between runs to speed up linting
