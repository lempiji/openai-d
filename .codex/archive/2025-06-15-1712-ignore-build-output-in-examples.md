### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-15 17:12]
  - **Task**: Add .gitignore files to examples
  - **Objective**: Prevent build artifacts from being committed
  - **Outcome**: Created standard .gitignore files for 11 example directories

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Template substitution automated creation of files
  - Tools ran without errors

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Linter and coverage build take noticeable time even for simple changes
  - dscanner output was verbose, obscuring success message

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Provide cached builds for dscanner and test dependencies to speed up checks
  - Reduce noise in linter output for easier confirmation
