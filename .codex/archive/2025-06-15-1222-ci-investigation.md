### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-15 12:22]
  - **Task**: Investigate CI failure
  - **Objective**: Determine why the `main CI` workflow fails and implement a fix if possible
  - **Outcome**: Local builds, lint, tests and examples succeeded for both DMD and LDC. Unable to reproduce CI failure without GitHub logs, so no fix applied.

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - The project setup script allowed running formatter, linter and tests easily.
  - CI workflow file was simple to inspect.

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Lacked access to GitHub Actions logs, so the failing step could not be identified.
  - Installing alternative D compilers via the provided script failed due to network restrictions.

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Provide a downloadable archive of recent CI logs in the repository to aid offline debugging.
