### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-18 22:37]
  - **Task**: Add project API key structs and tests
  - **Objective**: Implement missing data types for project API key management
  - **Outcome**: Added new structs with convenience constructors and unit tests. All checks and builds succeed.

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - OpenAPI spec provided the schema so implementation was straightforward.
  - Automation via dfmt, linter, tests, and example builds ensured consistency.

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Fetching dependencies during linting and example builds was slow in the container environment.
  - Navigating large YAML spec to find schema sections was cumbersome.

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Provide a local cached copy of the OpenAPI spec and frequently used packages to speed up development steps.
  - Add helper scripts for quickly searching schema definitions.
