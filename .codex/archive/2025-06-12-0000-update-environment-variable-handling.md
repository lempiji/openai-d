### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-12 00:00]
  - **Task**: Update environment variable handling
  - **Objective**: Ensure OPENAI_API_BASE uses default URL when unset or empty
  - **Outcome**: Changed configuration to use `environment.get(envApiBaseName, "")` and kept default fallback. Verified formatting, linting, tests, coverage and example builds.

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Tooling caught no issues after modification, making validation quick.

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Coverage files clutter the project root and are easy to forget to clean.

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Automate cleanup of coverage artifacts after tests
