### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-17 11:28]
  - **Task**: Update AuditLogActorSession fields
  - **Objective**: Add optional fields and tests for administration audit log session.
  - **Outcome**: Successfully implemented new optional fields ja3, ja4 and ipAddressDetails with tests and formatting.

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Automated tests and formatting tools caught issues early.
  - OpenAPI example helped clarify field structure.

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Serializing nested structs required trial and error due to default values.
  - Running dub commands repeatedly was slow in the container.

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Provide helper scripts for quickly testing serialization of individual structs without creating temporary projects.
