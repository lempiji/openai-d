### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-18 22:57]
  - **Task**: implement project api key endpoints
  - **Objective**: expose project API key management in client
  - **Outcome**: added methods and verified tests/builds pass

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - following existing patterns made implementation straightforward
  - automated formatting and linting caught no issues

#### :warning: Pain points
  - unclear API URL structure required assumptions
  - coverage generation produced many .lst files cluttering output

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - include API documentation links or specs in repo to clarify endpoints
  - add cleanup step for coverage artifacts in CI scripts
