### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-20 09:50]
  - **Task**: Delete helper methods
  - **Objective**: Remove redundant methods from OpenAI client
  - **Outcome**: Successfully relied on mixin implementations

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Build and test steps passed without issues
  - Sed patching allowed quick removal of large code blocks

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Example builds generated many artifacts, requiring cleanup
  - Linting step downloaded packages each run which slowed iteration

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Add a cleanup script to automatically revert example artifacts after builds
