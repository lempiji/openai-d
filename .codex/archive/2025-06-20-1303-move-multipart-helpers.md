### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-20 13:03]
  - **Task**: Move multipart helpers
  - **Objective**: Share multipart utilities between clients
  - **Outcome**: Functions relocated to `openai.clients.helpers` and tests updated

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Formatter and linter ran smoothly
  - Example build script helped confirm no regressions

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Cleaning generated example binaries after the build step took extra commands
  - Initial linter run failed due to unused variables in tests

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Extend `build_examples.sh` with a cleanup option to remove binaries automatically
  - Add a pre-lint step that flags unused variables during test updates
