### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-15 15:09]
  - **Task**: Rebuild all examples and fix style
  - **Objective**: Ensure examples compile after updating mir-ion
  - **Outcome**: All examples built successfully and extra blank lines removed

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Complete build with `scripts/build_examples.sh all` verified compatibility
  - Linter and tests passed without additional fixes

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Local build of all examples was slow due to repeated dependency compilation
  - Build artifacts cluttered the repo, requiring manual cleanup

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Extend build script to clean artifacts automatically after building
  - Investigate caching build outputs to speed up full example compilation
