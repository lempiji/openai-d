### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-15 14:54]
  - **Task**: Update mir-ion version in project and examples
  - **Objective**: Ensure compatibility with latest mir-ion release
  - **Outcome**: Updated dub configuration files and verified build

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Formatter and linter executed without issues
  - Tests and example builds succeeded on first attempt

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Fetching dependencies during linting took noticeable time on the CI container
  - Excess build artifacts needed manual cleanup after example compilation

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Add a cleanup step in build scripts to remove generated binaries automatically
  - Cache Dub dependencies to speed up linting and testing phases
