### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-20 15:41]
  - **Task**: Add reflection listing script
  - **Objective**: Provide a helper to quickly review all outstanding improvements
  - **Outcome**: Implemented `list_reflections.d` and documented its usage in AGENTS.md

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - D's standard library made file processing straightforward
  - Example build script already handled artifact cleanup after manual removal

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Running dfmt, lint, and tests for small changes still takes several minutes in this environment

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Cache dependencies for dfmt and dscanner to speed up formatter and linter steps
