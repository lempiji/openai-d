### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-17 11:56]
- **Task**: Run tests and build samples
- **Objective**: Ensure `dub test` and example builds succeed
- **Outcome**: Added missing import to fix build failure; all tests and example builds now succeed

#### :sparkles: What went well
- Tools like `dub` provided clear error messages
- Automated formatting and linting streamlined the workflow

#### :warning: Pain points
- Example build process is slow due to rebuilding dependencies
- Coverage generation produces many temporary files

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
- Provide a pre-built cache of dependencies to speed up example builds
