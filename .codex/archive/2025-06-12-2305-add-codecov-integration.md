### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-12 23:05]
  - **Task**: Add Codecov integration
  - **Objective**: Enable automated coverage reporting in CI
  - **Outcome**: Added Codecov config, updated CI workflow to upload coverage, and updated README badge

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Workflow changes applied smoothly and local tests passed

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Local: `dub lint` downloaded many dependencies, slowing the check

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Provide a cached Docker image with common D tools preinstalled to speed up local linting
