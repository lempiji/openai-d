### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-20 11:33]
  - **Task**: Apply review feedback on QueryParamsBuilder
  - **Objective**: Address comments by relocating the helper and simplifying compile-time checks
  - **Outcome**: Moved QueryParamsBuilder into `openai.clients.helpers` and tightened the static assert expression

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Running the formatter and linter ensured consistent code style
  - Example builds verified no regressions after refactoring

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Build artifacts from example compilation required manual cleanup
  - Waiting for dependency downloads slowed down the lint step

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Integrate a cleanup step in `build_examples.sh` to remove temporary outputs automatically
  - Cache linter dependencies in CI to speed up checks
