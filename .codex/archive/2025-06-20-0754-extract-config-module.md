### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-20 07:54]
- **Task**: Move OpenAIClientConfig into its own module and update imports
- **Objective**: Refactor configuration code for better modularity
- **Outcome**: Introduced new `openai.clients.config` module and adjusted project to use it. Tests and examples still build.

#### :sparkles: What went well
- dfmt, lint and test steps all ran smoothly after initial adjustments.
- Splitting the config class simplified `openai.d`.

#### :warning: Pain points
- The build_examples script produced many artifacts that needed manual cleanup, slowing down the workflow.
- Moving the class exposed private constructor issues requiring extra attention during tests.

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
- Add a cleanup step to `build_examples.sh` that removes generated executables and dub selection files automatically to keep the worktree clean.
