### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-20 12:08]
- **Task**: Move admin URL builder helpers
- **Objective**: Consolidate admin URL construction in `OpenAIAdminClient`
- **Outcome**: Functions previously in `clients/helpers.d` now live privately within `OpenAIAdminClient`, tests updated accordingly.

#### :sparkles: What went well
- Repository tooling (formatter, linter, tests) caught style issues quickly.
- Centralizing admin-specific helpers simplifies `ClientHelpers` mixin.

#### :warning: Pain points
- Linter warnings about duplicate visibility attributes required iterative fixes.
- Building example executables during checks was slow in the container environment.

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
- Provide a make target that skips example builds unless source changes warrant it, reducing build times during routine checks.
