### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-15 15:44]
  - **Task**: Encode include values in getResponse
  - **Objective**: Ensure query parameters are correctly escaped
  - **Outcome**: Updated implementation with URL encoding and added tests

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Project guidelines made formatting and linting straightforward
  - Example build script caught potential issues before commit

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Local, Ubuntu: creating a temporary dub project to inspect private functions was clumsy
  - Rebuilding dependencies during example compilation added noticeable time

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Provide a script or helper to quickly run small snippets against the library without crafting full dub projects
