### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-17 11:31]
- **Task**: Document audit log certificate events and update enum
- **Objective**: Ensure Administration models match OpenAPI and note spec discrepancies
- **Outcome**: Added certificate events to `AuditLogEventType`, updated tests, and confirmed formatting, linting, and examples build successfully

#### :sparkles: What went well
- Automated tooling (dfmt, linter, tests) ran smoothly and caught no issues
- OpenAPI spec available online helped confirm official event list

#### :warning: Pain points
- Building example applications is slow in the container, increasing turnaround time

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
- Provide prebuilt example binaries or a cached build directory to speed up iterative example compilation
