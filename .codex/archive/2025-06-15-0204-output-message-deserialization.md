### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-15 02:04]
  - **Task**: Fix OutputMessage deserialization
  - **Objective**: Ensure Algebraic output types parse correctly
  - **Outcome**: Added discriminated field annotations and tests

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Unit tests quickly revealed issues with enum parsing
  - dfmt and dscanner ran without problems

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Investigating mir-ion errors required trial and error
  - Understanding enum handling in mir-serde was unclear

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Document how mir-ion expects enums to be encoded to reduce debugging time
