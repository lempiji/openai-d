### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-18 10:47]
  - **Task**: Mark invites as work in progress
  - **Objective**: Ensure README feature table matches project status
  - **Outcome**: README updated and all checks passed

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Simple documentation update with clear instructions
  - Automated checks ensured repository consistency

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Build script generates many artifacts that require cleanup on every run
  - Running full example builds is slow on constrained environments

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Provide a cleanup command or script to remove build artifacts automatically
