### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-17 14:33]
  - **Task**: Add Files API support
  - **Objective**: Implement models, client methods, example and docs for the OpenAI Files endpoint
  - **Outcome**: Completed with working tests and examples

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Reused existing multipart helper for uploads with minimal effort
  - Documentation update and example compile cleanly

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Linter initially failed due to numeric literal style rule which was easy to miss
  - Building formatter and linter repeatedly slowed iteration in the container

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Provide a helper script to run formatting and linting together to reduce command overhead
  - Cache linter dependencies in the environment to speed up dscanner startup
