### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-19 12:43]
  - **Task**: Add administration_users example
  - **Objective**: Provide a sample program demonstrating listing organization users
  - **Outcome**: Created new example directory with build files and basic code

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Automated formatting and linting tools ran smoothly
  - Build script automatically compiled the new example

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Running the linter downloads several packages each time which slows feedback
  - Build examples script produced many deprecation warnings from dependencies

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Cache dscanner and other tools locally in CI to avoid repeated downloads
  - Silence third-party deprecation warnings when building examples
