### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-20 17:49]
  - **Task**: Document efficient dependency update procedure
  - **Objective**: Update AGENTS.md with steps for `dub add` and `dub upgrade`
  - **Outcome**: Added new section describing how to upgrade all packages and verified tests

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Repository already configured with dfmt, linter and tests, so verification was straightforward
  - No actual dependency changes were needed

#### :warning: Pain points
  - `dub lint` downloads many packages on first run which slows down the workflow

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Cache common tooling like `dscanner` in CI to avoid repeated fetches
