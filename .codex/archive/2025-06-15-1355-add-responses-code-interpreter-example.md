### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-15 13:55]
  - **Task**: Add responses code interpreter example
  - **Objective**: Provide an example demonstrating Python execution via `ResponsesToolCodeInterpreter`
  - **Outcome**: Example and build script updated, tests and builds all succeeded
#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Formatting, linting, and tests all passed without issues
  - Example compiled cleanly using the existing scripts
#### :warning: Pain points
  - Build logs are quite verbose and make it hard to verify which example compiled
  - Running coverage takes noticeable time during local workflow
#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Add a quieter build option that summarizes progress to reduce noise in logs
