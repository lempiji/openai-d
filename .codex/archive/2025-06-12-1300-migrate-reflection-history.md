### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-12 13:00]
  - **Task**: Migrate reflections to per-file format
  - **Objective**: Convert REFLECTION_HISTORY.md entries to individual files for better organization
  - **Outcome**: Created separate reflection files and removed the old history document

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Template made it easy to standardize each reflection

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Creating many files manually was repetitive

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Provide a script to automate migrating or creating reflection entries
