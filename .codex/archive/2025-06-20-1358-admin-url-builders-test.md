### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-20 13:58]
  - **Task**: Add admin API helper builders and tests
  - **Objective**: Implement reusable URL builders for admin endpoints and ensure encoding works
  - **Outcome**: Added helper methods, refactored client functions, and extended tests successfully

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Automated code formatting and linting kept style consistent
  - Unit tests verified new query parameter handling

#### :warning: Pain points
  - `dub lint` and `dub test` compilation time was long on the container environment
  - Example build output cluttered the git status and required cleanup

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Provide a script to clean example artifacts automatically after builds
