### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-18 22:07]
  - **Task**: Extend files example to demonstrate more operations
  - **Objective**: Provide complete usage sample covering file retrieval, download, and deletion
  - **Outcome**: Added new code to `examples/files/source/app.d` and verified compilation

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Example was straightforward to update using existing API methods
  - Build script quickly confirmed compilation without needing to run the API

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Running linter and formatter each time still requires downloading dependencies, which is slow in this environment

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Cache Dub dependencies in the CI or container to avoid repeated fetches during development
