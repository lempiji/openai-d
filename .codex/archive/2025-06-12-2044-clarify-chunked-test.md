### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-12 20:44]
  - **Task**: Clarify chunked upload unit test
  - **Objective**: Remove dynamic filename from expected string and use explicit value
  - **Outcome**: Updated unittest with static filename constant; all checks continue to pass

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Changing test expectations was straightforward

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Running dfmt and dub tools takes time as dependencies build

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Cache formatted binaries to avoid repeated compilation in CI
