### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-19 14:21]
  - **Task**: implement project service account methods
  - **Objective**: expose API endpoints for service account management
  - **Outcome**: methods and tests added, all checks passed

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Reused existing patterns for project user APIs to implement service account endpoints quickly
  - Unit tests verify URL builder behavior just like other endpoints

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Rebuilding example binaries still generates many warnings and temporary files, slowing down development on this container
  - Coverage runs are lengthy due to compiling dependencies

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Adjust build_examples.sh to clean generated artifacts automatically to reduce manual cleanup time
