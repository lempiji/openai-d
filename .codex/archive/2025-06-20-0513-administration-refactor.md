### :book: Reflection for [$(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M')]
- **Task**: administration module refactor
- **Objective**: reorganize administration code into multiple modules
- **Outcome**: Completed with adjustments; faced D module naming conflicts.

#### :sparkles: What went well
- Automation scripts built examples and tests successfully after fixes.
- Unit tests helped verify module refactoring correctness.

#### :warning: Pain points
- D's package/module rules caused conflicts when using `package.d` and backward compatibility file, leading to compilation errors.
- Repeated formatter and linter runs slowed iteration in container environment.

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
- Provide clear conventions for using `package.d` with compatibility modules to avoid naming conflicts and ensure smooth refactoring.
