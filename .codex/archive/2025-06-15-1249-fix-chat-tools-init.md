### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-15 12:49]
- **Task**: Fix examples using ChatCompletionTool initialization
- **Objective**: Correct initialization errors causing compile issues and update examples accordingly
- **Outcome**: Updated chat_db and chat_tools examples to remove extra "function" argument; tests and linters pass

#### :sparkles: What went well
- Dfmt quickly formatted updated files
- Test suite executed without failures after fix

#### :warning: Pain points
- Linter installation pulled many dependencies, slowing lint step
- Manual environment setup for dmd required script invocation

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
- Provide a script or container with preinstalled D toolchain and dscanner to speed up setup
