### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-15 14:18]
  - **Task**: Align README bullet
  - **Objective**: Correct indentation for the Administration checklist item
  - **Outcome**: Bullet aligned with others and repository formatting remained stable

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Simple documentation edit was straightforward
  - Automated checks ran without issues

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Running formatter and linter for a doc-only change felt excessive
  - Test suite adds time even when no code changed

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Add a lightweight path for documentation-only PRs that skips building steps
  - Cache dependencies locally to reduce test setup time
