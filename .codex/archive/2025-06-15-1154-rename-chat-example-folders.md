### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-15 11:54]
  - **Task**: Rename example directories and update references
  - **Objective**: Ensure directory structure uses new chat_* names
  - **Outcome**: Completed renames, updated Dub configs, adjusted .gitignore and ran all checks

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Automated renaming with `git mv` kept history intact
  - Formatter and linter ran smoothly without manual fixes

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Linter downloaded many dependencies, slowing the run
  - Coverage generation produced numerous .lst files that clutter the workspace

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Cache dscanner and dfmt builds across runs to avoid repeated compilation
