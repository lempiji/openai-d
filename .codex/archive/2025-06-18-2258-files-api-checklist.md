### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-18 22:58]
  - **Task**: Mark Files API implemented
  - **Objective**: Update README API checklist entry to show completion
  - **Outcome**: Documentation now lists Files API as ready and notes supported operations

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Workflow tools ran smoothly with no errors
  - Documentation update was straightforward

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Running tests and coverage for docs-only changes added overhead on local machine
  - Fetching linter dependencies each run slowed feedback

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Provide cached binaries for dscanner and dfmt to speed up non-code documentation updates
