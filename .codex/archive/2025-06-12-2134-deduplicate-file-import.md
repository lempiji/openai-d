### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-12 21:34]
  - **Task**: Address review comment
  - **Objective**: Remove duplicate File imports across audio methods
  - **Outcome**: Moved `import std.stdio : File;` to module level and cleaned up local imports

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Code cleanup was straightforward

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Rebuilding dfmt each run slows down the workflow

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Cache dfmt binaries between runs to speed up formatting
