### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-14 18:27]
- **Task**: Adjust ResponsesResponse to handle null fields
- **Objective**: Fix deserialization of API responses with null values
- **Outcome**: Updated struct members to use Nullable and confirmed tests pass

#### :sparkles: What went well
- Compilation and unit tests ran quickly
- The project tooling made it easy to format and lint changes

#### :warning: Pain points
- Understanding mir-serde's error messages was difficult when deserialization failed
- Running `dub test` repeatedly slowed iteration during debugging

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
- Document common mir-serde errors in CONTRIBUTING to speed up future debugging
