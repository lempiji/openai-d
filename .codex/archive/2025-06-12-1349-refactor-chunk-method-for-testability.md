### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-12 13:49]
  - **Task**: Refactor streaming audio methods for testability
  - **Objective**: Extract chunked file logic into a private method and add unit tests
  - **Outcome**: Added `appendFileChunked` helper with accompanying unittest

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Reused existing style for private method tests

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Verifying streaming behavior required extra setup with temp files

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Introduce helpers for creating temporary test resources
