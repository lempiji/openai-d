### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-18 12:33]
  - **Task**: Add invite types
  - **Objective**: Implement invite-related structs and tests from the OpenAPI schema
  - **Outcome**: New structs added with passing tests

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Access to the official OpenAPI spec made modeling straightforward
  - Automated tools (dfmt, dscanner, dub test) ensured code quality

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Running small ad-hoc programs with dub was awkward due to single-file recipe syntax

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Provide a helper script for quickly compiling and running snippets using the project's dependencies
