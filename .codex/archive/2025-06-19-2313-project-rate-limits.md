### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-19 23:13]
  - **Task**: implement project rate limits
  - **Objective**: extend admin client with project rate limit endpoints and example
  - **Outcome**: implemented data types, client methods, example program, docs updated, and checks passed

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Adding new structs followed clear patterns from existing code
  - Formatter and linter quickly highlighted minor style issues

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Locating official API details for rate limits required guessing field names due to missing openapi specs
  - Applying README patches was tricky because of exact line matching and quoting

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Provide a helper script that inserts example snippets into README to reduce manual patching errors
  - Host an offline copy of the OpenAI OpenAPI spec within the repo so field details are readily available
