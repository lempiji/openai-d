### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-28 04:15]
  - **Task**: Improve multi-file chat example
  - **Objective**: Address reviewer feedback on sample text, cleanup, and changelog
  - **Outcome**: Enhanced sample data, automatic file cleanup, and updated changelog. Formatting, linting, tests, coverage, and example build all succeeded.

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Using `scope(exit)` provided a clean way to remove uploaded files.
  - All project checks and builds passed without issues.

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Waiting for dfmt and dscanner dependencies was slow because they were re-fetched each run.

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Cache dfmt and dscanner binaries locally to speed up formatting and linting steps.

#### :mortar_board: Learning & Insights
  - Merging changelog sections requires careful editing to preserve bullet order.

#### :link: References
