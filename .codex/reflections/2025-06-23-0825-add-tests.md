### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-23 08:25]
  - **Task**: implement unit tests
  - **Objective**: increase coverage for new helpers and models
  - **Outcome**: added tests and verified formatter, linter, examples

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - dfmt and lint ran without issues
  - coverage shows helper file fully covered

#### :warning: Pain points
  - QueryParamsBuilder had no failing scenarios so error case was less meaningful

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Expand QueryParamsBuilder with validation to allow real error tests

#### :mortar_board: Learning & Insights
  - Example build script touches many directories in core mode
  - `mir.serde` gracefully ignores unknown JSON fields

#### :link: References
  - `source/openai/clients/helpers.d`
