### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-23 01:34]
  - **Task**: update audit logs example with project ID filter
  - **Objective**: demonstrate filtering audit logs by project ID and event type
  - **Outcome**: example builds and tests pass

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Clear AGENTS instructions guided the build steps
  - Formatter and linter ran without issues after installing tools

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Building example groups with underscores required using the `all` mode, not `core`, which initially caused a mismatch

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Document the difference between `core` and `all` modes in the build script help output

#### :mortar_board: Learning & Insights
  - The build script excludes underscored directories in `core` mode
  - Example builds rely on `dub build` in each directory

#### :link: References
  - `scripts/build_examples.d`
