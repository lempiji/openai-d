### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-27 23:36]
  - **Task**: Move and enhance chat streaming design document
  - **Objective**: Convert existing design into a proposal under docs/design, update its content and references
  - **Outcome**: Proposal created with updated date and README link, index file added

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Editing and restructuring the document was straightforward
  - Build and tests all succeeded without issues

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Running the formatter and linter downloads dependencies each time, which slows down short documentation tasks

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Cache dfmt and dscanner binaries in the development container to avoid repeated downloads

#### :mortar_board: Learning & Insights
  - Familiarity with the repository's design documentation workflow ensures consistency across new proposals
  - Running build scripts even for doc changes helps verify environment health

#### :link: References
  - docs/design/AGENT.md for proposal guidelines
