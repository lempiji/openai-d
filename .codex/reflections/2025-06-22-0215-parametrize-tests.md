### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-22 02:15]
- **Task**: Consolidate buildList*Url unittests
- **Objective**: Simplify tests with a single parametrized block while preserving coverage
- **Outcome**: Success; replaced many blocks with data-driven loop

#### :sparkles: What went well
- dfmt and lint ran smoothly with cached dependencies
- Parameter table allowed clearer assertion patterns

#### :warning: Pain points
- Crafting the tuples was verbose and errorâ€‘prone
- Cleaning example build artifacts manually slowed commits

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
- Add a helper script to clean example artifacts automatically after builds

#### :mortar_board: Learning & Insights
- Large loops in D unittests can reduce duplication without sacrificing clarity
- Keeping negative checks may require structuring data beyond simple string lists

#### :link: References
- D documentation on unittests and std.typecons.tuple
