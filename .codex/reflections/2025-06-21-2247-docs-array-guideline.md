  - **Task**: revise array parameter docs
  - **Objective**: move new example from README to AGENTS per review comment
  - **Outcome**: added guideline bullet in AGENTS and reverted README section

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Formatter and linter finished without issues
  - Tests and examples built successfully

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Large coverage outputs clutter the repository root

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Store coverage files in a dedicated directory to keep the workspace clean
