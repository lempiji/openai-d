### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-22 03:01]
- **Task**: Standardize case titles in admin URL helper tests
- **Objective**: Make test output easier to interpret with consistent naming
- **Outcome**: Renamed data table cases following "resource scenario" pattern

#### :sparkles: What went well
- dfmt and dscanner ran without issues
- Consolidated build_examples output remained clean

#### :warning: Pain points
- Minor manual cleanup of example binaries still required
- Finding a clear naming scheme took a few attempts

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
- Provide script option to automatically delete generated example executables

#### :mortar_board: Learning & Insights
- Consistent test case names help quickly identify failing scenarios
- Using short descriptors keeps table-based tests readable
