### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-28 02:09]
  - **Task**: Draft proposal for chat file messages
  - **Objective**: Explain how to support file attachments in Chat Completion messages
  - **Outcome**: Created design document and updated index

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Repository already had clear templates for proposals
  - Writing the solution sketch was straightforward after examining current chat message structs

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Remembering to update the proposal index manually could be error prone

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Add a script that automatically updates `INDEX.md` when new proposals are added

#### :mortar_board: Learning & Insights
  - The chat module only supports text and image message types currently
  - Reviewing the Python sample clarified the needed structure for file messages

#### :link: References
  - docs/design/AGENT.md
  - README snippet demonstrating Files API usage
