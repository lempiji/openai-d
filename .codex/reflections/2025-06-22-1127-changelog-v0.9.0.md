### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-22 11:27]
  - **Task**: Write CHANGELOG for v0.9.0
  - **Objective**: Document major changes since v0.8.0
  - **Outcome**: Added CHANGELOG.md summarizing new features and improvements

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Quickly gathered commit history using Git
  - Summarized key enhancements without reading every commit

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Large number of commits made it hard to pinpoint highlights

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Provide concise release notes or milestones to simplify changelog creation

#### :mortar_board: Learning & Insights
  - `git log` with ranges is useful for summarizing changes
  - Running dfmt, linter, and tests ensures documentation updates donâ€™t break CI

#### :page_facing_up: Reference Info
  - [AGENTS.md instructions for formatting and tests](../AGENTS.md)
