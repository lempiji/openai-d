### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-28 02:30]
  - **Task**: Implement chat file message helper
  - **Objective**: Add `userChatMessageWithFile` and update changelog
  - **Outcome**: Created new struct and helper, updated tests and docs

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - dfmt and linter caught no style issues
  - Running coverage ensured new tests executed

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Setting up a temporary dub project to inspect serialization was cumbersome

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Provide a small script for quickly compiling sample code with local dependencies

#### :mortar_board: Learning & Insights
  - `ChatUserMessageFileContent` requires a nested struct to match OpenAI JSON
  - Example builds use `all` mode when directories contain underscores
