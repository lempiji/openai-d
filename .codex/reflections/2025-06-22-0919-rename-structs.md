### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-22 09:19]
- **Task**: Rename request/response structs
- **Objective**: Ensure naming consistency across modules
- **Outcome**: Updated structs, clients, tests, and examples; all checks pass

#### :sparkles: What went well
- Automated search-and-replace helped update references quickly
- Formatter and linter ran without issues

#### :warning: Pain points
- Long build times when compiling examples slowed iteration

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
- Cache compiled example artifacts between builds to reduce waiting time

#### :mortar_board: Learning & Insights
- Consistent naming simplifies API usage and documentation
- Running build scripts with `--clean` can remove lockfiles, so restore them before committing

#### :link: References
- openai library source and build scripts
