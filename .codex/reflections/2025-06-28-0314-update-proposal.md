### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-28 03:14]
  - **Task**: Update proposal and changelog after file message implementation
  - **Objective**: Align documentation with the new chat file feature and finalize version notes
  - **Outcome**: Proposal marked approved, changelog updated under v0.9.0

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - The proposal already contained most of the code snippets so updates were minimal
  - Automated build and test scripts confirmed no regressions after documentation changes

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Removing the v0.10.0 section required careful sed ranges to avoid deleting the wrong lines

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Provide a helper script to update version sections in the changelog safely

#### :mortar_board: Learning & Insights
  - Running the formatter and linter even for doc changes avoids CI surprises
  - Example build artifacts must be cleaned before committing
