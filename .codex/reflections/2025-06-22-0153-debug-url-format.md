### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-22 01:53]
- **Task**: Apply diff comments and convert remaining methods
- **Objective**: Ensure every request uses helper routines and logs the request URL
- **Outcome**: Updated all admin client methods to rely on helpers and improved debug output

#### :sparkles: What went well
- The helper mixin simplified replacing repetitive HTTP setup
- Formatter and tests caught no new issues after refactoring

#### :warning: Pain points
- Manual patching of many functions was tedious and error-prone

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
- Add script to rewrite functions using old HTTP patterns automatically

#### :mortar_board: Learning & Insights
- `debug scope(failure)` with URLs provides useful context when failures occur
- Consolidating request logic helps maintain consistency across modules

#### :link: References
- std.net.curl documentation
