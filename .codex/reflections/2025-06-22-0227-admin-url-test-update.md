### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-22 02:27]
- **Task**: Refine admin URL helper parameterized tests
- **Objective**: Address feedback by building URLs inside loop and running full example build
- **Outcome**: Tests consolidated with delegate-based table; examples compile cleanly

#### :sparkles: What went well
- Running build_examples with --clean kept the repo tidy
- Delegates captured requests without complex types

#### :warning: Pain points
- Example build still slow even for small changes
- Cleaning binary artifacts manually after `--clean` still required attention

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
- Add script option to remove example executables after builds

#### :mortar_board: Learning & Insights
- Delegates are useful for parameterizing tests with various request types
- Keeping version-controlled example selections requires restoring after cleanup

#### :link: References
- D language delegate syntax documentation
