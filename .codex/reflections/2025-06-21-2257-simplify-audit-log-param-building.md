### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-21 22:57]
  - **Task**: Refactor buildListAuditLogsUrl
  - **Objective**: Replace manual loops with QueryParamsBuilder's array support
  - **Outcome**: Code simplified and tests still pass

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Small change compiled quickly
  - Existing tests ensured correctness

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Fetching dependencies for linting adds several seconds
  - Coverage files clutter repository root

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Cache dscanner and dfmt binaries between runs to avoid rebuilds
