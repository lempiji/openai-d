### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-21 02:49]
  - **Task**: Update AGENTS.md directory structure
  - **Objective**: Ensure documentation reflects current repository layout
  - **Outcome**: Added detailed directory listing and committed changes

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Straightforward inspection of repo folders
  - Tests and tooling ran without issues

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Waiting for dfmt and linter builds was slow in the container

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Cache dfmt and dscanner binaries to speed up checks
