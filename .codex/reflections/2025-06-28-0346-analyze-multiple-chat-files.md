### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-28 03:46]
  - **Task**: Add example uploading multiple files
  - **Objective**: Demonstrate how to attach several files in a chat message and guide the model to analyze them.
  - **Outcome**: Updated the chat_files example to upload two text files and send them with a question. Documented the change and ensured style and tests pass.

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - dfmt and dscanner ran without issues.
  - Example built successfully with the helper script.

#### :warning: Pain points
  - build_examples script ignored the chat_files group when using the `core` mode which the instructions initially suggested.

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Document in AGENTS.md that groups with underscores require the `all` mode when building examples.

#### :mortar_board: Learning & Insights
  - Verified how to manually construct `ChatMessage` with multiple `ChatUserMessageFileContent` entries.

#### :link: References
  - `scripts/build_examples.d` logic for group selection
