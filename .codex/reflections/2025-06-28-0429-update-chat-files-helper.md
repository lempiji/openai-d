### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-28 04:29]
  - **Task**: Improve chat_files example and library helper
  - **Objective**: Address reviewer comments to clean up uploads and add a helper for multi-file messages
  - **Outcome**: Added userChatMessageWithFiles helper, updated example cleanup, merged changelog entry, and ensured all project checks pass

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Running dfmt and dscanner produced no style issues
  - The new helper made the example code much shorter

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Manually inspecting coverage outputs is tedious

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Provide a script to summarize coverage percentages automatically

#### :mortar_board: Learning & Insights
  - scope(exit) near each upload ensures failed uploads are handled correctly
  - Writing helpers keeps example code readable

#### :link: References
  - openai/chat.d helper functions
