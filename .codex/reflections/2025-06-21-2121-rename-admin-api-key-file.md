### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-21 21:21]
  - **Task**: Rename administration/api_key.d to administration/admin_api_key.d
  - **Objective**: Ensure the code base uses consistent naming for admin API key module and passes all checks
  - **Outcome**: File renamed, imports updated, and all tests and builds succeeded

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - `dub` tools handled the rename smoothly
  - Automated formatting and linting ran without issues

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Linting and formatting took noticeable time due to dependency compilation in this environment

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Cache `dfmt` and `dscanner` binaries to avoid rebuild delays
