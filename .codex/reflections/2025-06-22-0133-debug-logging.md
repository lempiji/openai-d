### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-22 01:33]
- **Task**: Apply diff comments and review debug logging
- **Objective**: Honor feedback to improve helper routines
- **Outcome**: Added debug output and corrected DELETE implementation

#### :sparkles: What went well
- Formatter, linter, and tests passed without issues
- Helper methods now handle logging consistently

#### :warning: Pain points
- Cleaning up build artifacts after running examples is tedious

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
- Provide a script to purge temporary example artifacts

#### :mortar_board: Learning & Insights
- `debug scope (failure)` simplifies conditional debug logs
- Using `HTTP.perform` respects custom callbacks like `onReceive`

#### :link: References
- std.net.curl documentation
